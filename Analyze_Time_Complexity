In linear search the worst case scenario time will be O(n)
because we have traverse each and every element in the list and we 
might not find it or find it at last.
In Binary search the worst case scenario time will be O(log n)
because each time we split our list into two and traverse only that
list thats range satisfied out target value

However for binary search to work list have to sorted and this is the 
only bound for it to work  but linear search can be work in any way because it search each element one at time.
